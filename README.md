# 가위 바위 보!
# Translation: Rock Paper Scissors!

Rock, Paper, Scissors game inspired by Korean Netflix original 'Squid Game.'
The game has a user interface with buttons that allows users to select rock, paper or scissors which will be validated and allow the computer to generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and display it. Both choices will be compared and a display will appear determining the result of the round.

# Challenges
1. Learning that Chrome had updated their autoplay policy to improve UE, which made it difficult to allow an autoplay audio feature to be added to the site. Additionally, the setting to allow autoplay was also completely removed from Chrome's browser. There were multiple solutions to resolve this issue for this project, however upon research, it involved topics that were not within my scope of experience or knowledge or it only applied to videos, not audio. This resulted in the decision to not include it for the initial upload as it may not be appropriate/wise to use if I could not understand nor explain the code for it.
2. Getting the results to display an empty string instead of "It's a TIE" when the page initially loads.
3. Working with media queries from desktop to mobile. It was a little bit difficult starting with desktop view, then to tablet, and then mobile. Therefore, it would be more suitable, especially in during this era, where starting off with mobile view may be better in practice.
